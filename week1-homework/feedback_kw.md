# Week 1 Genome Assembly -- Feedback

1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9 points out of 10 possible points

1. Question 1.1, 1.4 how many reads (0.5 pts each)

  * good --> +1

2. Question 1.2, 1.4 simulation script(s)

  * fantastic --> +1

3. Question 1.2, 1.4 plotting script(s)

  * code for plots looks fantastic! --> +1

4. Question 1.2, 1.4 histograms with overlaid Poisson distributions (0.5 pts each)

  * I don't see the plots; please add --> +0

5. Question 1.3, 1.4 how much of genome not sequenced/comparison to Poisson expectations (0.5 pts each, 0.25 for answer and 0.25 for code)

  * good --> +1

6. Question 2 De novo assembly (0.5 pts each, 0.25 for answer and 0.25 for code)

  * number of contigs --> +0.5
  * total length of contigs --> +0.5

7. Question 2 De novo assembly cont (0.5 pts each, 0.25 for answer and 0.25 for code)

  * size of largest contig --> +0.5
  * contig n50 size --> +0.5

8. whole genome alignment (0.33 pts each, 0.33/2 for answer and 0.33/2 for code)

  * average identity --> +0.33
  * length of longest alignment --> +0.33
  * how many insertions and deletions in assembly --> +0.33

9. decoding the insertion (0.5 pts each, 0.25 for answer and 0.25 for code)

  * position of insertion in assembly --> +0.5
  * length of novel insertion --> +0.5 ; you want to add one to the length. length is end - beginning +1 so that you count the last one. If you start counting at 1 and go to 10, there are 10 numbers. But if you subtract 10 - 1, you only get 9.

10. decoding the insertion cont (0.5 pts each, 0.25 for answer and 0.25 for code)

  * DNA sequence of encoded message --> +0.5
  * secret message --> +0.5
